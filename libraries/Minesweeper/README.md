Things to add to Minesweeper (in no particular order):

1. end screen menu (for both winning and losing)
2. game win condition (right now there is no way to win)
3. protection against clicking flagged block
4. nicer flags (currently it is just a blue dot)
5. start game menu (with option to select difficulty)
6. better random mine selection (right now it just picks random blocks and doesn't check if they are already picked)
7. maybe a way to move more than one block at a time (like click and hold)
